In this assignment you will implement the PageRank algorithm used for ranking webpages. You 
will then analyze the results of the algorithm as you vary its parameters.  
 
You must complete this assignment on your own, not in a group. You are highly encouraged to 
use Python. 
 
• Your code must obey the specified input-output format, accepting input from a text file 
and writing output to another text file. 
• Other than numerical computing libraries like NumPy or SciPy, and built-in functions 
such as a random number generator, you cannot use any libraries. 
• You need to turn in source code and a report (PDF and 1 page).
